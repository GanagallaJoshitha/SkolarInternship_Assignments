Activate the virtual environment and install a Python library of your choice (e.g., NumPy) within this environment. 

Open the terminal and activate the virtual environment.

Install NumPy within the activated virtual environment by running:
  >> pip install numpy
After installing Numpy you can check the installed packages using:
>> pip list


Write a Python script that imports the library and performs a basic operation (e.g., creating an array or matrix).

import numpy as np
#Creating an array
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("Created NumPy array:", array)
