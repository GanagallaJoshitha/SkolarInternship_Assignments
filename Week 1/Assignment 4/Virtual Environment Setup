Explain the concept of virtual environment in Python.

-A virtual environment in Python is like a self-contained sandbox where you can install packages and dependencies for a specific project, isolated from your global Python installation and other projects. 
-This helps avoid version conflicts and keeps your project environment clean and reproducible.
-Python virtual environments allow developers to control software dependencies in Python code. 
They're useful ways of ensuring that the correct package/library versions are consistently used every time the software runs.

Why is it important, especially in data science projects?

-Virtual environments are crucial in data science projects because they keep project dependencies isolated and organized.
-Ensuring consistent and reproducible results without conflicts between different versions of libraries or packages.

Create a virtual environment named "ml_env" using the venv module 

Run the following command to create the virtual environment: 
>> python -m venv ml_env

Activate the virtual environment:
>>ml_env\Scripts\activate

To deactivate the virtual environment:
>>deactivate
