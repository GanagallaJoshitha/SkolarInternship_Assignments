Merging: Merge the "feature-branch" into the main branch. 
Explain the merge process and resolve any conflicts if they occur


---Explanation of the Merge Process
->Switching Branches: You switch to the main branch to ensure you are merging into the correct branch.
->Merging: The git merge feature-branch command merges the changes from feature-branch into main. If there are no conflicts, the merge will complete automatically.
->Conflict Resolution: If there are conflicts (i.e., changes that can't be automatically merged), Git will mark the conflicts in the affected files. 
   You must manually edit the files to resolve the conflicts and then add and commit the resolved files.
->Pushing Changes: After merging, you push the changes to the remote repository to update the main branch on GitHub.
